I learned how to make this project from this tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Cr00UYokU&t=27s"

But I adjusted the color of the app according to the profile picture I used and I've also added some features, such as highlighting the Navbar using React Scroll and displaying a Pop-Up Notification after the user has successfully sent a message.

The pictures I used for this project are from pixabay.
