# React JS Exercises (Part 1)

This is a react responsive portfolio website. If you are interested in how this project works, you can visit "https://ucilasmana.github.io/template_cv_1/"

I learned how to make this project from this tutorial "https://youtu.be/G-Cr00UYokU?si=HQ_w4HiS6KGRQDPW"

But I adjusted the color of the app according to the profile picture I used and I've also added some features, such as highlighting the Navbar using React Scroll and displaying a Pop-Up Notification after the user has successfully sent a message.

The project use these packages:
1. EmailJS to send messages
2. Swiper React to show testimonials
3. React Scroll for Navbar
